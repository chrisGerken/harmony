1) Add an integer attribute named bestScore to BoardState. The value of bestScore is effectively the minimum of the score of the board state and the score of the parent of the board state. While not necessary at this time, persist and restore this value when writing and reading board states to and from the file system.

2) Add a command line configuration value, named -sb (for steps back), for HarmonyServer with a default value of 1.

3) In StateProcessor, change the behavior of the saveBoardStates().  In the normal logic portion of the method only save to cache or PendingStates those board states whose scores are less than or equal to the sum of the board state's current score and the steps back configuration value from (2) above. Any board states who fail that test should be discarded and counted as being pruned.
