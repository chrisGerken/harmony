1) in the processState() method in StateProcessor, in the loop iterating over possible moves do not increment the generated and  pruned counters in PendingStates. Instead, count the number of new generated states and the number of pruned states and the add those numbers to the respective atomic counters in PendngStates after the iteration over possible moves completes

2) Add a copy method to class Tile. Create an array of 1 million Tiles and compare the time required to copy those tiles with the new copy method vs. using the clone() method and print results. If the clone method is not faster then replace all references of the clone() method with the new copy() method

3) Create several additional puzzles with Generator to test code changes: 1) a 3 tile square with 8 moves, 2) a 4 tile square with 9 moves and 3) another 3 tile square with 12 moves
