1) Support the idea of a board's score. We need to add an Integer attribute with default value null to Board to hold the score when we calculate the score, but there will be times that we do not, for now, calculate a board's score. Once calcuated, a board's score needs to be persisted and recovered when writing and reading board states. For the board score's getter method, if the score is null then calculate and save the score.

2) The score is calculated by adding all of the following:
- the number of tiles that are not in their target row
- for each column, the number of tiles in the column minus the number of uniquely colored tiles in that column
- for each tile with more than two remaining moves, the number of remaining moves minus 2.

3) The toString() method of Board should write the score on it's own line

4) TestBuilder should display the score of each board in the sequence of boards shown in the solution
