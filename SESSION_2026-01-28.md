# Session 17 - January 28, 2026

## Summary

Simplified the board scoring heuristic by removing component 3 (excess remaining moves).

## Changes Made

### 1. Board.java - Simplified Score Calculation

**File**: `src/main/java/org/gerken/harmony/model/Board.java`

**Change**: Commented out component 3 of the `calculateScore()` method.

**Before**: Score = (tiles not in target row) + (duplicate colors per column) + (excess moves per tile)

**After**: Score = (tiles not in target row) + (duplicate colors per column)

**Rationale**: Simplifies the heuristic to focus purely on positional factors. The excess moves component is preserved as commented code for potential future use.

**Code changes**:
- Lines 156-165: Component 3 loop commented out
- Lines 111-117: Javadoc updated to reflect only 2 components

## Files Modified

1. `src/main/java/org/gerken/harmony/model/Board.java` - Score calculation simplified
2. `CURRENT_STATE.md` - Updated for Session 17
3. `docs/DATA_MODELS.md` - Updated score formula documentation
4. `SESSION_2026-01-28.md` - This file (new)

## Testing Notes

The change affects the board scoring heuristic used for:
- Queue prioritization in PendingStates (lower score = higher priority)
- Cache threshold decisions in StateProcessor
- Steps-back pruning decisions

Consider testing with various puzzle sizes to verify the simplified heuristic still provides effective guidance toward solutions.
